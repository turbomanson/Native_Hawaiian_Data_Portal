# Project Name:	Native Hawaiian Data Portal  
Start Date:	April 2019  
Completion Date: TBD  
Sponsor: LT & KS	Project Management Leads:	Palama Lee and Wendy Kekahio  

## Project Overview  
### Project Background:  
The Aliʻi Trusts and other Native Hawaiian (NH) serving organizations can contribute in important ways to advance the wellbeing of Native Hawaiians by increasing access to reliable and timely data for purposes such as to map assets, assess needs, plan, evaluate, and identify trends over time. Given the likelihood that 50% of NHs will report living in the other 49 states by the next decennial Census, understanding the conditions of NHs and ensuring open access to data appears critical. Presently, few data repository options exist for the public to obtain data on NHs, and they include The Office of Hawaiian Affairs’ (OHA) Data Book and Kamehameha Schools’ (KS) Huakaʻi. A Native Hawaiian Data Portal (NHDP) or a centralized data repository would be an available and accessible repository for individuals, organizations, and communities to obtain Native Hawaiian data. 

### Business Need:  
Creating conditions of thriving for Native Hawaiians require accurate and accessible data to inform strategic, programmatic, policy, and resourcing decisions. Creating a NHODP requires collaborations and partnerships with organizations interested in promoting the wellbeing of the Native Hawaiian population.  
  
### Calendar Year 2019 Objectives:  
•	To agree on the function and structure of a NHDP  
•	To create a work plan for this project  
•	To create and implement the planning phase of a work plan  
•	To initialize the portal with links to publically available data and reports relevant to NH wellbeing  
  
Guiding questions –  What data on Native Hawaiians are available to inform strategic, programmatic, policy, and resourcing decisions to advance well-being? How can access to these data be facilitated through a data portal?  

### Calendar Year 2019 Outcomes:  
•	Complete process documents (e.g., Charter and/or Concept Paper)  
•	Create a work plan for a NHDP  
•	Execute the planning phase of the work plan.  
•	Portal with links to publically available data and reports relevant to NH wellbeing  
  
### Participants:  
The criteria for participation include stakeholders with a desire to advance NH well-being by promoting the accessibility of NH population- and community-level data and organizations that have an interest in furthering research and evaluation on these levels.
